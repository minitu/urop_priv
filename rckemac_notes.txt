[Intro]
- SCC board (Rocky Lake board) = BMC (Board Management Controller) + FPGA + Rock Creek chip
- MCPC has 2 ethernet ports (eth0: connect to Internet, eth1: connect to BMC) and a PCIe interface
- BMC: used for hardware control and monitoring. Users telnet into BMC to power on/off the Rock Creek chip, read status, etc. BMC connects to the cores with a JTAG interface. It also connects to the FPGA.
- FPGA: connects to the Rock Creek chip over the PCIe interface
- Rock Creek chip: 4 x 6 array of 24 tiles with 2 P54C cores per tile
- With sccKit 1.4.0, cores use both PCIe and eMAC to communicate with MCPC

[The eMAC Interface]
- eth1 is part of the eMAC interface
- Programs on the cores can send data to MCPC over eth1
- Cores use Ethernet over eMAC to communicate with MCPC
- 2 choices: Ethernet over PCIe and Ethernet over eMAC
- But no reason to choose Ethernet over PCIe (has known bugs), so choose Ethernet over eMAC!
- System communicates with MCPC over PCIe for sccKit commands, and over eMAC for core programs
